        <p>
          In many countries, air pollution reaches hazardous levels, and getting information air quality is difficult, if not impossible. [1]
        <p>
          As sensors become cheaper and more abundant, a future in which this type of data is more freely accessible becomes possible. As part of a partnership between Swissnex, Grey Area and Lift Conference, more than 100 batteries of air quality sensors were set up in seven cities across the globe. These collect readings every 10 seconds, and the data they produce are freely accessible to anyone with an internet connection. [2] Seeing the Air is an exploration of how this type of data could be used to increase understanding of air quality.
        <p>
          The visualization above is an expressive view of the data. It depicts five days of bad air quality. Each chart is a 24-hour clock, each hand depicting the worst air quality index score for that hour.
        <p>
          Clicking a chart will reveal a set of visualizations for the selected city. These visualizations allow users to explore air quality data, and to help them find answers to questions that affect the quality of life: Is the air ever hazardous? If so, how often? What is the air like during commute hours?

        [1] In China, for example, reliable data on air pollution is often not available. See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/science/earth/beijing-air-pollution-off-the-charts.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/science/earth/beijing-air-pollution-off-the-charts.html</a>
